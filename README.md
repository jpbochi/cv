I'm a challenge-driven person. Nothing motivates me more than a hard problem to solve. I’m highly devoted to quality in every aspect of what I do. I praise knowledge, and I like to share it. I have constant interest in learning new technologies, processes, and paradigms.

I started coding early in the 90s, with QuickBasic. I graduated in CS in 2004. Today, I have a decade and a half of professional programming experience. I wrote a lot of C# before I became a polyglot programmer writing Ruby, Java, Scala, and JavaScript (my current favorite). In the past ~6 years, I spent a lot of time automating infrastructure with AWS, Bash, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, and others. I'm passionate about CI/CD, and tend to be the guy that pushes the team forward to enhance our test and deploy pipeline.

In my free time, I do books, movies, beer, 3D printing, and some eventual programming for fun. I'm fond of open source, and made contributions of my own. In 2015, I helped [protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com/) set up their early CI pipeline for their open source web UI. 5 years later, I ended working for them.

I feel at home being the technical leader of projects, especially if there's time pressure. I like to search for ways where my team can get better, and be an influencer to improve those. That _leadership role_ is that one excel at, and is the one I search for. I do not aspire to have any managerial position. Nothing against managers, it's just not for me.

#### Professional Experience

- *Nov 2020 to present, OmniPresent*

I had the honor of being the second engineer in the company. While laying architectural groundwork, I took a leadership role in several engineering projects this hopeful young company executed.

- *Sep 2019 to Nov 2020, ProtonMail*

I'm fully assigned to help the company to have a DevOps transformation. I built from scratch a Kubernetes-based replacement for the company's QA and Staging machines. It includes automated deploys to fully isolated environments from every branch.

- *2016 to 2019, Rackspace*

I helped build the software behind Rackspace's Managed AWS offering. I worked with billing, logging, and alerting automation. One product I helped build from scratch sets up version-controlled infrastructure pipelines for customers using GitHub, Terraform, and CircleCI. It currently manages both AWS and GCP.

- *2014 to 2016, SoundCloud*

I rewrote a system responsible for processing and storing data sent by external partners. I kept some of the original design, but built all the infrastructure automation, and integration with our continuous delivery pipeline. Last time I checked, we had 150+ TB. As the system had to be expanded with extra features, I became the informal technical leader of a small team of 4 engineers.

- *2011 to 2014, ThoughtWorks*

There, I became a full-fledged professional. I got used to programming in many languages and operating systems. Agile got in my blood. CI and CD became routine.

I've worked for 3 very distinct products there. The first used C#, SQL Server, and loads of JavaScript. The second was ecommerce system for one of the biggest media holdings in Latin America. The architecture we designed was heavily based in micro-services written in Ruby, with data storage in MongoDB. The third was the customer-facing control panel of a large cloud hosting company in the US. The continuous delivery was amazingly efficient, especially considering the size of the team.

- *2006 to 2011, Dell Inc.*

From the first day, I worked with distributed teams, and cooperating with people from very different cultures (e.g. Americans, Indians, Malaysians, etc.). I worked directly with many corporate technologies, like Oracle DB, SQL Server, VB6, C# 4.0, ASP.NET MVC, IBM MQSeries, Microsoft TFS, and others.

- *2000 to 2006, a few different companies*

#### Extra-Professional Work / Open Source / Hobby Programming

- *drun*: It's a wrapper around docker run that will mount the current directory and a few other tricks. It's useful to run some python/node/ruby/whatever script without having to install anything locally. Code at https://github.com/jpbochi/drun.

- Some other contributions to open source, including [mochajs.org](htts://mochajs.org), [ko-validation](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ko-validation), a [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) extension, [halberd](https://www.npmjs.org/package/halberd) (a [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) library).

- *Duelo, a board game*: This is the game I built in my teens, and made some rewrites over the years. In the rewrites, I focused more on boardgames engine underneath than on Duelo itself. In one attempt, I used C# and a frontend with HTML5 Canvas and jQuery. It was even worth a post at [AppHarbor's blog](http://blog.appharbor.com/2011/2/16/featured-app-rook) at the time.

#### Education

Computer Science degree at [UFRGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Rio_Grande_do_Sul) (from 2000 to 2004). My focus areas were AI and CG. My conclusion project was a system that recreated 3D models from photos.

#### Teaching/Coaching

- Instructor at Microsoft Student to Business Advanced (2009 and 2010): A set of official MS courses were instructed to a class of high-school and undergraduate students. I taught VS 2008: ADO.NET 3.5 (6464A) and MCF (6461A).

- Instructor at Rails Girls (November 2013): I was one of the instructors. Details at the [ThoughtWorks' blog](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rails-girls-y-thoughtworks).
