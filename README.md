I consider myself a challenge-driven person. Nothing motivates me more than a hard problem to solve. I’m highly devoted to quality in every aspect of what I do. I praise knowledge, and I like to share it. I have constant interest in learning new technologies, processes, and paradigms.

My programming experience started with QuickBasic in the beginning of the PC era when I was a child. I was using VB before I finished high school. I’ve become skilled in OO after I started learning C++. My professional experience sums to about 8 years in computer programming. For a long time, I focused on C# and .NET. Since I joined ThoughtWorks, I became a polyglot programmer. Now, I do lots of Javascript and Ruby.

At my free time, my favorite activities are reading (Portuguese and English), watching movies, and drinking draught beers with friends. Of course, I do some programming too. I’ve been maturing the art of developing highly reusable frameworks, even open sourcing a couple. I already contributed for [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) and coauthored [ko-validation](https://github.com/racker/ko-validation/).

I dream of finishing this pet project of mine. It’s an engine for abstract board games. See the largest attempt at [rook.apphb.com](http://rook.apphb.com). My ultimate career goal is to become technical guru, where I'd still code, and would give advise in development of different projects.

#### Professional

- *Ecoplan Engª Ltda. (about 2 years - from 2000 to 2003)*
I started as a trainee, and later, as a freelancer. I enhanced a couple of internal civil engineering applications. I also improved the company’s websites (intranet and internet). I used VB 6, SQL Server, ADO, ASP, HTML, and JavaScript.

- *NTConsult (about 4 months - first half of 2003)*
I created some tools required by a project requested by the Brazilian Federal Government.

- *Scherer Informática (1 1/2 years – from August 2004 to February 2006)*
I worked there as a programmer/analyst customizing Microsoft Solomon (an ERP software for small businesses) and Microsoft CRM 1.2. My main programming platform was C# with ASP.NET 1.1 and Ajax.

- *DbServer (3 months – from March 2006 to May 2006)*
I was hired as a software engineer for a large enterprise. We used Oracle, C#, ASP.NET 1.1, and IBM Rational ClearCase.

- *Stefanini Consulting (Almost 2 years – from June of 2006 to March of 2008)*
I worked as a software developer exclusively for Dell. Later, I was hired there.

- *Dell Inc. (3 years - from April 2008 to April 2011)*
I worked on several projects. From highly dependable, and distributed logistics server applications to front end self-updatable customer care software.
Since the first day, I worked with distributed teams, and cooperating with people from very different cultures (e.g. Americans, Indians, Malaysians, etc.). I worked directly with a broad array of corporate technologies, like Oracle DB, SQL Server, VB6, C# 4.0, ASP.NET MVC, IBM MQSeries, Microsoft TFS, and others.

- *ThoughtWorks (since April 2011)*
There, I learned more about software development than any other place before in my life. I got used to programming in many languages and operating systems. Agile got in my blood. CI and CD became routine. Finally, I started to feel like a full-fledged professional.

I've been in 3 very distinct products there, so far. The first one was an website for teachers to author exams, all confirming to standards dictated by different states in the US. It was quite challenging frontend development. We ended up developing a custom Javascript framework for the project (it was too late to introduce an existing one when we realised we needed it).

The second was ecommerce system for one of the biggest media holdings in Latin America. It included both a web store, an internal control website, many micro-services, and mobile apps for customers to read content. I helped develop all the composing parts of the system, from backend to web and mobile. I did lots of JavaScript (with jQUery and Zepto) and Ruby. I even submitted a couple of pull requests for Zepto (which is jQuery for mobile).

The third (and current) is the customer-facing control panel of a large cloud hosting company in the US. I work almost exclusively on the browser-side of the application. Priorities are strongly driven by A/B testing, client feedback, and usage statistics. JavaScript is 90% of the code I write for this project.

#### Extra-Professional Work / Hobby Programming

- *JP Labs Blog (on hold since 2011)*
While I was at Dell, I played a lot with C#, and maintained a personal programming blog ([JP Labs](http://jp-labs.blogspot.com.br/)). Subjects varied from mult-threading and immutability to custom C# events, dynamic coding, and even derivatives. All code is available at a [bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/jpbochi/jplabscode).

- *ko-validation, a [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) extension*
Along with a coworker, we created this extension to _Knockout_ for easier input custom validation. Code is available at [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ko-validation]).

- *halberd, a HAL library for both client and server*
It's a library for [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), and JSON format with standardised hypermedia links. I started by forking and existing abandoned library and mine has increasingly more active users. Also available at [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/halberd).

- *Duelo, a board game*
I've been trying to rewrite this game I created as a child for many years now. I decided to start by building an engine for board-games first, because it would be more fun and more interesting. In one attempt, [Rook](http://rook.apphb.com/), I used C# and a frontend with HTML5 Canvas and jQuery. It was even worth a post at [AppHarbor's blog](http://blog.appharbor.com/2011/2/16/featured-app-rook) at the time. My latest attempt is in pure Javascript with Node.js. It's not playabled yet, as I'm still trying lots of ideas. Code is available at [my github](https://github.com/jpbochi/duelo).

#### Education
- Computer Science degree at UFRGS (from 2000 to 2004)
My focus areas were compilers, AI, and CG. My conclusion project was a system that recreated 3D scenes from photos.

#### Courses
- Instructor at Microsoft Student to Business Advanced (2009 and 2010)
A set of official MS courses were instructed to a class of high-school and undergraduate students. In 2009, I was the instructor of the Course 6464A (VS 2008: ADO.NET 3.5). In 2010, I instructed the course 6461A (VS 2008: MCF).

- Instructor at Rails Girls (November 2013)
Event was hosted at ThoughtWorks Porto Alegre. I had the honor to be one of the instructors. Know more about the event at [thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rails-girls-and-thoughtworks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rails-girls-and-thoughtworks)

#### Languages
- English, fluent
I have solid English skills. I studied for 3 years at ICBNA (aka Cultural). I read and write in English intensively. I talk daily with native English speakers. I’ve already travelled to US, France, Germany, and India, where English was crucial.
