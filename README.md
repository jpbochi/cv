I'm a challenge-driven person. Nothing motivates me more than a hard problem to solve. I’m highly devoted to quality in every aspect of what I do. I praise knowledge, and I like to share it. I have constant interest in learning new technologies, processes, and paradigms.

My programming experience started with QuickBasic in the beginning of the PC era when I was a child. I have over 13 years of professional programming experience. I wrote a lot of C# before I became a polyglot programmer. I did Ruby, Java, and Scala. Today, mostly JavaScript. In the past 5 years, I spent a lot of time automating infrastructure with AWS, Bash, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, and others. I'm passionate about CI/CD, ad tend to be the guy that pushes the team forward to enhance our test and deploy pipieline.

 At my free time, I do books, movies, beer, and some eventual programming for fun. I'm fond of open source. I contributed to [mocha](http://mochajs.org/), and coauthored a couple of other smaller libraries ([ko-validation](https://github.com/racker/ko-validation/) and [halberd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/halberd), for example). I helped [protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com/) set up a continuous integration pipeline.

I don't aspire to any managerial position. I feel at home being the technical leader of projects, especially if there's time pressure. I like to search for ways where my team is slacking, and be an influencer to improve those.

#### Professional Experience

- *2000 to 2006, a few different companies*
Check my [linkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/jpbochi) for more details.

- *2006 to 2011, Dell Inc.*

Since the first day, I worked with distributed teams, and cooperating with people from very different cultures (e.g. Americans, Indians, Malaysians, etc.). I worked directly with many corporate technologies, like Oracle DB, SQL Server, VB6, C# 4.0, ASP.NET MVC, IBM MQSeries, Microsoft TFS, and others.

- *2011 to 2014, ThoughtWorks*

There, I became a full-fledged professional. I got used to programming in many languages and operating systems. Agile got in my blood. CI and CD became routine.

I've worked for 3 very distinct products there. The first used C#, SQL Server, and loads of JavaScript. The second was ecommerce system for one of the biggest media holdings in Latin America. The architecture we designed was heavily based in micro-services written in Ruby, with data storage in MongoDB. The third was the customer-facing control panel of a large cloud hosting company in the US. The continuous delivery was amazingly efficient, especially considering the size of the team.

- *2014 to 2016, SoundCloud*

I rewrote a system responsible for processing and storing data sent by external partners. I kept some of the original design, but built all the infrastructure automation, and integration with our continuous delivery pipeline. Last time I checked, we had 150+ TB. As the system had to be expanded with extra features, I became the informal technical leader of a small team of 4 engineers.

- *2016 to present, Rackspace*

I help build the software behind Rackspace's Managed AWS offering. I worked with billing, logging, and alerting automation. One product I helped build from scratch sets up version-controlled infrastructure pipelines for customers using GitHub, Terraform, and CircleCI. It currently manages both AWS and GCP.

#### Extra-Professional Work / Hobby Programming

- *ko-validation, a [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) extension*
Along with a coworker, we created this extension to _Knockout_ for easier input custom validation. Code at [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ko-validation).

- *drun*
It's a wrapper around docker run that will mount the current directory and a few other tricks. It's useful to run some python/node/ruby/whatever script without having to install anything locally. Code at https://github.com/jpbochi/drun.

- *halberd, a HAL library for both client and server*
It's a library for [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), and JSON format with standardised hypermedia links. I started by forking and existing abandoned library and mine has increasingly more active users. See [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/halberd).

- *Duelo, a board game*
This is the game I've been planning to rewrite for years. I decided to start by building an engine for board-games first, because it would be fun and interesting. In one attempt, [Rook](http://rook.apphb.com/), I used C# and a frontend with HTML5 Canvas and jQuery. It was even worth a post at [AppHarbor's blog](http://blog.appharbor.com/2011/2/16/featured-app-rook) at the time.

#### Education

Computer Science degree at [UFRGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Rio_Grande_do_Sul) (from 2000 to 2004). My focus areas were AI and CG. My conclusion project was a system that recreated 3D models from photos.

#### Teaching/Coaching
- Instructor at Microsoft Student to Business Advanced (2009 and 2010): A set of official MS courses were instructed to a class of high-school and undergraduate students. I taught VS 2008: ADO.NET 3.5 (6464A) and MCF (6461A).

- Instructor at Rails Girls (November 2013): I was one of the instructors. Details at the [ThoughtWorks' blog](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rails-girls-y-thoughtworks).
