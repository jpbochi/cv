I'm a challenge-driven person. Nothing motivates me more than a hard problem to solve. I’m highly devoted to quality in every aspect of what I do. I praise knowledge, and I like to share it. I have constant interest in learning new technologies, processes, and paradigms.

My programming experience started with QuickBasic in the beginning of the PC era when I was a child. I was using VB before I finished high school. I’ve become skilled in OO after I started learning C++. My professional experience sums to about 10 years in computer programming. For a long time, I focused on C# and .NET. At ThoughtWorks, I became a polyglot programmer, learning Ruby and proper Javascript. At SoundCloud, I do mostly Scala. I also automated part of our infrastructure using AWS, Bash, Docker, and a bit of Ansible.

 At my free time, I do books, movies, beer, and some eventual programming for fun. I'm fond of open source. I contributed to [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/), and coauthored a couple of other smaller libraries ([ko-validation](https://github.com/racker/ko-validation/) and [halberd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/halberd), for example). I helped [protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com/) set up a continuous integration pipeline.

I don't aspire to any managerial position. I'm the technical leader of a small team at the moment. For future career development, I want to either lead larger teams or be a part of a small high-impact project where quality and time to market is crucial.

#### Skills and Qualifications

- Full-stack poliglot software development
- Implementing and maintaining continuous delivery pipelines
- Javascript, C#, Ruby, Java, Scala
- AWS, Docker, Ansible
- Mongo, Redis, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle DB
- Node.js, jQuery, Knockout, Jasmine, Mocha

#### Professional Experience

- *2000 to 2006, several different companies*
Check my [linkedIn](http://br.linkedin.com/in/jpbochi) for more details.

- *2006 to 2011, Dell Inc.*
I started as a contractor, and was eventually hired. I worked on wide variety of projects, from highly dependable distributed logistics server applications to front end self-updatable customer care software.

Since the first day, I worked with distributed teams, and cooperating with people from very different cultures (e.g. Americans, Indians, Malaysians, etc.). I worked directly with many corporate technologies, like Oracle DB, SQL Server, VB6, C# 4.0, ASP.NET MVC, IBM MQSeries, Microsoft TFS, and others.

- *2011 to 2014, ThoughtWorks*
There, I became a full-fledged professional. I got used to programming in many languages and operating systems. Agile got in my blood. CI and CD became routine.

I've worked for 3 very distinct products there. The first was an uniquely complex single-page web app, with capabilities to compose exams that are applied to many students across the USA. We used C#, SQL Server, and loads of JavaScript.

The second was ecommerce system for one of the biggest media holdings in Latin America. The architecture we designed was heavily based in micro-services written in Ruby, with data storage in Mongo.

The third was the customer-facing control panel of a large cloud hosting company in the US. The continuous delivery was amazingly efficient, especially considering the size of the team.

- *2014 to present, SoundCloud*
I rewrote a system responsible for processing and storing data sent by external partners. I kept some of the original design, but built all the infrastructure automation, and integration with our continuous delivery pipeline. Last time I checked, we had 150+ TB. As the system had to be expanded with extra features, I became the informal technical leader of a small team of 4 engineers.

#### Extra-Professional Work / Hobby Programming

- *JP Labs Blog (abandoned since 2011)*
While I was at Dell, I played a lot with C#, and maintained a personal programming blog ([JP Labs](http://jp-labs.blogspot.com.br/)). Subjects varied from mult-threading and immutability to custom C# events, dynamic coding, and even derivatives. All code is available at a [bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/jpbochi/jplabscode).

- *ko-validation, a [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) extension*
Along with a coworker, we created this extension to _Knockout_ for easier input custom validation. Code is available at [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ko-validation]).

- *halberd, a HAL library for both client and server*
It's a library for [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), and JSON format with standardised hypermedia links. I started by forking and existing abandoned library and mine has increasingly more active users. Also available at [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org/package/halberd).

- *Duelo, a board game*
This is the game I've been planning to rewrite for years. I decided to start by building an engine for board-games first, because it would be fun and interesting. In one attempt, [Rook](http://rook.apphb.com/), I used C# and a frontend with HTML5 Canvas and jQuery. It was even worth a post at [AppHarbor's blog](http://blog.appharbor.com/2011/2/16/featured-app-rook) at the time. My latest attempt is in pure Javascript with Node.js. It's not playable yet, as I ended up using it as plaything to try lots of ideas. Code is available at [my github](https://github.com/jpbochi/duelo).

#### Education
- Computer Science degree at UFRGS (from 2000 to 2004)
My focus areas were AI and CG. My conclusion project was a system that recreated 3D models from photos.

#### Teaching/Coaching
- Instructor at Microsoft Student to Business Advanced (2009 and 2010)
A set of official MS courses were instructed to a class of high-school and undergraduate students. In 2009, I was the instructor of the Course 6464A (VS 2008: ADO.NET 3.5). In 2010, I instructed the course 6461A (VS 2008: MCF).

- Instructor at Rails Girls (November 2013)
Event was hosted at ThoughtWorks Porto Alegre. I had the honor to be one of the instructors. See more details at the [ThoughtWorks' blog](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rails-girls-y-thoughtworks).

#### Languages
- Portuguese, native
- English, fluent
I have solid English skills. I studied for 3 years at ICBNA (aka Cultural). I read and write in English intensively. I've been talking daily with native English speakers for years, and now I live in Berlin where I speak more English than anything else.
