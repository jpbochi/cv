I was born in 1981 and I’m 28 years old now. I completed my graduation degree in 2004 in Computer Science at UFRGS, one of the top universities in Brazil.

I consider myself a challenge-driven person. Nothing motivates me more than a hard problem to solve. I’m highly devoted to quality in every aspect of what I do. I praise knowledge, and I like to share it. I have constant interest in learning new technologies, processes, and paradigms.

My programming experience started with QuickBasic in the beginning of the PC era when I was a child. I was using VB before I finished high school. I’ve become skilled in OO after I started learning C++. My professional experience sums to about 8 years in computer programming. For a long time, I focused on C# and .NET. Since I joined ThoughtWorks, I became a polyglot programmer. Now, I do lots of Javascript and Ruby.

At my free time, my favorite activities are reading (Portuguese and English), watching movies, and drinking draught beers with friends. Of course, I do some programming too. I’ve been maturing the art of developing highly reusable frameworks, even open sourcing a couple. I dream of finishing this pet project of mine. It’s an engine for abstract board games. See one initial attempt at rook.apphb.com.

My latest career plan is to become a technical coding architect. Although my current work is focused is C# and corporate software, I never lost my passion for CG and AI. So I look forward to work in these areas. Also, I plan to get a post-graduation degree sometime in the future.

### Professional Experience

- Ecoplan Engª Ltda. (about 2 years - from 2000 to 2003)
I started as a trainee, and later, as a freelancer. I enhanced a couple of internal civil engineering applications. I also improved the company’s websites (intranet and internet). I used VB 6, SQL Server, ADO, ASP, HTML, and JavaScript.

- NTConsult (about 4 months - first half of 2003)
I created some tools required by a project requested by the Brazilian Federal Government.

- Scherer Informática (1 1/2 years – from August 2004 to February 2006)
I worked there as a programmer/analyst customizing Microsoft Solomon (an ERP software for small businesses) and Microsoft CRM 1.2. My main programming platform was C# with ASP.NET 1.1 and Ajax.

- DbServer (3 months – from March 2006 to May 2006)
I was hired as a software engineer for a large enterprise. We used Oracle, C#, ASP.NET 1.1, and IBM Rational ClearCase.

- Stefanini Consulting (Almost 2 years – from June of 2006 to March of 2008)
I worked as a software developer exclusively for Dell. Later, I was hired there.

- Dell Inc. (since April 2008, totaling about 5 years at Dell)
I continued the work I started as a contractor as Stefanini.
The first project I worked on was a highly dependable and distributed one. It coordinated Dell’s logistics through several facilities around the globe. On 2009, I moved to Dell Financial Services (DFS). My projects ranged from customer care software to online sales.
Since the first day, I worked with distributed teams, and cooperating with people from very different cultures (e.g. Americans, Indians, Malaysians, etc.). I worked directly with a broad array of technologies, like Oracle DB, SQL Server, VB6, C# 4.0, ASP.NET MVC, IBM MQSeries, Microsoft TFS, and others.

### Education
- Computer Science degree at UFRGS (from 2000 to 2004)
My focus areas were compilers, AI, and CG. My conclusion project was a system that recreated 3D scenes from photos.

### Courses e Certifications
- Poscomp 2005
It’s a test that is broadly used by universities in Brazil to select their post graduate students. I’ve scored 2.4 standard deviations above the average. I didn’t engage in post-graduation at the time for personal reasons.

- Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist
30/Aug/2005 = Developing and Implementing Windows-based Applications with MS C# .NET (070-316)
20/Dec/2006 = 070-536 TS: MS .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation (070-536)
3/Oct/2007 = 070-529 TS: MS .NET Framework 2.0 - Distributed Application Development (070-529)
27/Mar/2008 = 070-562 TS: MS .NET Framework 3.5, ASP.NET Application Development (070-562)

- Microsoft Student to Business Advanced (2009 and 2010)
A set of official MS courses were instructed to a class of high-school and undergraduate students. In 2009, I was the instructor of the Course 6464A (VS 2008: ADO.NET 3.5). In 2010, I instructed the course 6461A (VS 2008: MCF).

### Languages
- English
I have solid English skills. I studied for 3 years at ICBNA (aka Cultural). I read and write in English intensively at work and for fun (e.g., my blog). Currently, I have the luck to practice conversation daily with native English speakers. I’ve already travelled alone to US and Europe, where I’ve exercised English a lot. I intend to get a certification (TOEFL or TOEIC) when the time is ripe.

### Technological Experience Summary (not necessarily professional)
- C#, Javascript, Ruby, and a little Python
- Mongo, Redis, SQL Server, Oracle
- Git, Mercurial, SVN, TFS
